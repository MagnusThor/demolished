# Demolished

Demolished is a app/library for JavaScript 'browser demos' and shader-fun in general. It includes a web-ui  that gives you the possibillity to 'live code' ( change) the scenes, playpack, timing and audio syncronazation as well add and remove effects to the scenes (demo). You can "build" tiny executables for playback-only or record the playback as video. 

Demolished supports audio formats such as streaming (mp3's), SID, and minimalistic music synth's such as Sonant.     

## Dox

We are currently working on writing a brief documentation, but we are focusing on getting all our ideas in place.

## Other

In parallel with our free-time-work with demolished we are creating useful help libraries such as procedural texture generation, compression and optimization. Note we are doing this for fun!.

One example is this initiative ; https://github.com/MagnusThor/demolishedTexture
