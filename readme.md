# Demolished

Demolished is a app/library for JavaScript 'browser demos' and shader-fun in general. It includes a web-ui (editr)  that gives you the possibillity to 'live code' ( change) the scenes, playpack, timing and audio syncronazation as well add and remove effects to the scenes (demo). You can build tiny "executables" for playback-only or record the playback as video. 

Demolished supports audio formats such as streaming (mp3's), SID, and minimalistic music synth's such as Sonant (  Based on the js-sonant player by Marcus Geelnard  and Sonant by Jake Taylor, aka Ferris / Youth Uprising)
)     

## Dox

We are currently working on writing a brief documentation, but we are focusing on getting all our ideas in place.

## Piple line (Inprogress)

    - Timeline - Add, remove and modify TimeFragments ( segments ) using the UI. This features enables multiple effects , audio and scene managament. 
    - Buffer/Channels - Multiple Shader buffers/Channels 
    - Custom Uniforms - Add , Remove and modify uniforms using property-boxes.
    - Enhanced vertex shaders.
    - TextureGenerator - Embed and create a UI for the generator.  
    - 2D layers with custom inline TS/JS code.

TBD

## Other

In parallel with our free-time-work with demolished we are creating useful help libraries such as procedural texture generation, compression and optimization. Note we are doing this for fun!.

One example is this initiative ; https://github.com/MagnusThor/demolishedTexture
